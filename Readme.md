# SODAQ ONE Tracker specs

Note: to be able to compile this application you need to add the right board file to your Arduino IDE.

Go to File, Preferences and set the following URL for the additional board files:

http://downloads.sodaq.net/package_sodaq_index.json

##  Configuration Menu

After compiling the sourcecode and loading it onto the board you will be able to configure the board through a menu.

Just open the Arduino Serial Monitor (at 9600 baud) and you will get this menu:
```

Entering commands is just a matter of typing the command as given in brackets with the right value. For example:

fi=5

Will set the time between the GPS fixes to 5 minutes.

The following parameters must be configurable through the menu:

**Configuration Parameters**

| Description | Length |
| --- | --- |
| Fix Interval  default | Minutes |
| Fix Interval alternate | Minutes |
| From | time HH:MM |
| To | time HH:MM |
| GPS fix timeout | seconds |
| DEVADDR |   |
| APPSKEY |   |
| NWSKEY |   |
| Number of coordinates to upload (1-4) |   |
| Repeat count (default 0) |   |

The LoRa communication must only start when the keys are not 0 (which is the default)

#### Sleep
After the startup the device by default willt be in deep sleep mode. In sleep it uses less than 50 uA. Using the RTC Timers it will wake up at the set intervals.

#### Timers and Watchdog
The application is based on the RTCTimer library. At startup the application tries to obtain a GPS fix until timeout. If no fix can be obtained initially the location will be set to 0,0. Once the first fix is obtained the RTC will be set and that fix location will be kept until the next proper fix.

There is a system watchdog running in case the application hangs it will be restarted by the watchdog. (See library Sodaq\_wdt)

#### GPS fixes
As seen in the configuration menu we allow for two different schedules for GPS fixes based on UTC time. The default could for instance be that we want a GPS fix every 30 minutes during the night, but during the day we want a fix every 5 minutes. In that case we configure the default to be 30 minutes, but the optional fix timer to be 5 minutes from 06:00 UTC to 18:00 UTC.

The RTC library allows for two of such timers. In case the second Fix interval is set to 0 the second timer is simply ignored.

After a GPS fix is obtained with at least 'Minimum sat count' satellites (or the timeout reached) a LoRa packet will be sent. In case of timeout without obtaining enough satellites,
the best GPS fix found (if any) is used.

For redundancy we could configure a repeat count. The value of the repeat count tells us to send the Lora frame an additional number of times (default 0) for redundancy.

The Lora frame should contain the below data. The minimum frame size is 21 bytes, the maximum frame size 51 bytes, depending on the number of coordinates we have configured to be sent.

#### LoRa Connection
If 'Retry conn.' is on, then in case the connection to the network is not successful (useful for OTAA), the application will retry to connect the next time there is a pending transmission.




#### LoRa Frame content

| Description | Length |
| --- | --- |
| Epoch Timestamp | long (4) |
| Battery voltage (between 3 and 4.5 V) | uint8 (1) |
| Board Temperature (degrees celcius) | int8 (1) |
| Lat | long (4) |
| Long | long (4) |
| Altitude (MSL in meters  below sea level is set to FFFF) | uint16 (2) |
| Speed (SOG \* 100 km/h) | uint16 (2) |
| Course (COG) | uint8 (1) |
| Number of satellites | uint8 (1) |
| Time to fix (seconds, FF = no fix, in that case the above position is the last known) | uint8 (1) |
| Plus 0 - 3 of the following 10 bytes: |   |
| Previous fix (seconds ago, FFFF means longer than) | uint16 (2) |
| Lat | long (4) |
| Long | long(4) |



#### Remote (over the air) re-configuration

You can send the following configuration parameters back to the device (as part as the LoRaWAN class A communication protocol)



| Description | Length |
| --- | --- |
| Fix Interval  default | uint16 (2) |
| Fix Interval alternate | uint16 (2) |
| From (EPOCH) | long (4) |
| To (EPOCH) | long (4) |
| GPS fix timeout in seconds | uint16 (2) |
